# Add all the commits you would like to be omitted from the `git blame` output here.
# Add one commit per line and a comment with the reason for the omission.

# In order to use this file, you either need to add it to your config:
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
# or pass it as an argument to `git blame`:
# git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs <file>

# To remove the settings from your config:
# git config --unset blame.ignoreRevsFile
# or pass the --ignore-revs-file option with an empty value:
# git blame --ignore-revs-file="" <file>

# While this setting isn't automatically picked up git, it is used by GitHub based on the file name

# ignore the "Format with black" commit since it affects many files with no logic impact
